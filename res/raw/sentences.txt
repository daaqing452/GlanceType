be home before midnight
he played a pimp in that movie
I skimmed through your proposal
he was wearing a sweatshirt
no more war no more bloodshed
toss the ball around
I will meet you at noon
I want to hold your hand
the children are playing
superman never wore a mask
I listen to the tape everyday
he is shouting loudly
correct your diction immediately
seasoned golfers love the game
he cooled off after she left
my dog sheds his hair
join us on the patio
these cookies are so amazing
I can still feel your presence
the dog will bite you
a most ridiculous thing
where did you get that tie
what a lovely red jacket
do you like to shop on Sunday
I spilled coffee on the carpet
the largest of the five oceans
shall we play a round of cards
olympic athletes use drugs
my mother makes good cookies
do a good deed to someone
quick there is someone knocking
flashing red light means stop
sprawling subdivisions are bad
where did I leave my glasses
on the way to the cottage
a lot of chlorine in the water
do not drink the water
my car always breaks in the winter
santa claus got stuck
public transit is much faster
zero in on the facts
make up a few more phrases
my fingers are very cold
rain rain go away
bad for the environment
universities are too expensive
the price of gas is high
the winner of the race
we drive on pathways
go out for some pizza and beer
effort is what it will take
where can my little dog be
if you were not so stupid
not quite so smart as you think
do you like to go camping
this person is a disaster
the imagination of the nation
universally understood to be wrong
listen to five hours of opera
an occasional taste of chocolate
victims deserve more redress
the protesters blocked all traffic
the acceptance speech was boring
work hard to reach the summit
a little encouragement is needed
stiff penalty for staying out late
exceed the maximum speed limit
in sharp contrast to your words
this leather jacket is too warm
consequences of a wrong turn
this mission statement is baloney
you will loose your voice
every apple from every tree
are you sure you want this
the fourth edition was better
this system of taxation
beautiful paintings in the gallery
a yard is almost as a meter
we missed your birthday
coalition governments never work
destruction of the rain forest
I like to play tennis
acutely aware of her good looks
you want to eat your cake
machinery is too complicated
a glance in the right direction
I just cannot figure this out
please follow the guidelines
an airport is a very busy place
mystery of the lost lagoon
is there any indication of this
the chamber makes important decisions
this phenomenon will never occur
obligations must be met first
valid until the end of the year
file all complaints in writing
tickets are very expensive
a picture is worth many words
this camera takes nice photographs
it looks like a shack
the dog buried the bone
the daring young man
this equation is too complicated
express delivery is very fast
I will put on my glasses
a touchdown in the last minute
the treasury department is broke
a good response to the question
well connected with people
the bathroom is good for reading
the generation gap gets wider
chemical spill took forever
prepare for the exam in advance
interesting observation was made
bank transaction was not registered
your etiquette needs some work
we better investigate this
stability of the nation
house with new electrical panel
our silver anniversary is coming
the presidential suite is very busy
the punishment should fit the crime
sharp cheese keeps the mind sharp
the registration period is over
you have my sympathy
the objective of the exercise
historic meeting without a result
very reluctant to enter
good at addition and subtraction
six daughters and seven sons
a thoroughly disgusting thing to say
sign the withdrawal slip
